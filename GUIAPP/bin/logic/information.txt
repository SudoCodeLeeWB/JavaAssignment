2. Product related functions.  - what data structure we are going to use?
    1. the user can find a product using the keyword.  
    2. the admin can add/delete/edit a product. 
    3. the product structure : we are going to make a class for the product and add it into the arrayList. 


3. The user can view the product in the main page. 
    the buttons will be included in the panel #5 and will use the layout setting for buttons. 
    These buttons will show the image of the product. 


4. The owner can view the Orders. 
    we need a Queue data structure to store the Orders. 
    define the Queue as Static .
